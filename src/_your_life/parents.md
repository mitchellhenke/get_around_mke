title: Parents

It is common refrain that while car-free living may be "nice," it is infeasible for parents. This ignores the thousands of parents living in the Milwaukee area without access to a vehicle, or with only inconsistent access. Not only is it possible to be a parent and live without a car, many people are already doing so.

Children do add some additional considerations when living a car-free life. If you own a car, try committing to smaller changes first, and take things slowly. The good news is that many children are excited by aspects of car-free life, including biking and transit. Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause for child death, leave thousands of children injured every year, and are a top contributor to child head trauma. The reality is that for most children, driving is the most dangerous activity they encounter in their every day life.

## Biking with Kids

There are several ways to bike with kids, depending on your needs, budget, and kids' skill level:

- Biking with kids on their own bikes
- Added kid seating on your bike, or a trailer
- Dedicated cargo bike, either a "longtail" or "box bike"
