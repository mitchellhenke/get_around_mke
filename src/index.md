Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for Milwaukee residents to learn how to navigate their streets when they do not have access to a car. Written by Milwaukeeans, for Milwaukeeans.

Whether you have never driven, want to save on gas, or your circumstances have changed, this website is for you. We want to make it easy to learn how to get around, whether that's for just one trip or for a long-term lifestyle change. Approximately 16% of Milwaukee households do not have access to a vehicle. Getting around without a car is not "alternative transportation." It is the reality for thousands in our city, and with some planning, it can work for you, sometimes with surprising benefits.
