Biking is often misunderstood. Some people believe either that all people who use bikes are very wealthy and ride expensive road bikes; others believe that those who depend on bikes are very poor. The truth is that people who ride bikes are incredibly diverse -- and bikes are also diverse. People of all ages are able to use bikes. Bikes can be very affordable, but a decent-quality bike that meets frequent city needs may be more expensive. Different kinds of bikes can make errands and transporting children easier, but may be more expensive or heavier. Biking is overall very safe, but requires some planning and awareness of best biking behavior to be very safe. Biking is possible in the winter, but again requires some planning.

Beginning biking can be intimidating. Our top tips? Take the bike you have (or borrowed from a friend) to a familiar, nearby location, like a coffee shop or school. You will likely want to avoid the roads you drive on - instead, take residential roads. You do not need to commit to every trip by bike; just start slow. When in doubt, go on a group ride and talk with others on the ride. People who ride bikes are almost always happy to share tips and tricks.
