## Getting to the Airport

Flying out of Mitchell Airport? Take MCTS's Green or 80 lines. They will drop you off at the entrance (pick you up too, of course). The Green line operates 24/7. Depending on the time of day, you will likely wait no longer than 5-20 minutes for the bus. Not that much longer than waiting for a rideshare or walking to parking - and a heck of a lot cheaper.
If you don't normally take the bus, take note of the fare and how to get on.

### How to get on the bus
We recommend using an app like Google Maps or Apple Maps. Enter your starting address and ending address (Mitchell Airport). Switch to the transit view, and they will show you which stop to use. You may need to transfer from a line closer to you, to the 18 or Green. This can be a little intimidating, but looking at the map before you leave will help you be more familiar.
### Fares
You will either need cash ($2.25), the UMO app (add a few bucks to your account), or a Wisgo card. If you use the app or card, you will only pay $2. Your transfer will happen automatically if you use the app or card, but if you use cash and need to transfer, tell the driver when you get on.
Right now, the app and card allows you to pay for one person. They are looking to improve this, but until then, everyone should either have the app downloaded, or have their own Wisgo card. Kids under 5 ride the bus for free. Kids under 12 have a lower fare.

## Getting to Chicago
Going to Chicago? Why deal with Illinois drivers? Instead of being in Chicago traffic and paying for parking, try a train or bus.
### Amtrak
Amtrak runs the Hiawatha train line between Milwaukee and Chicago. One-way trips cost $25, and a roundtrip costs $50.

### Bus
- Take a bus to O'Hare airport from the Milwaukee Intermodal station
- Unfortunately, there is no direct transit from Milwaukee to midway. You can get to Chicago and use local public transit to access Midway Airport.

## Getting to Madison

There are many buses to and from Madison each day, for about $26/trip.

## Hiking and Camping

We wanted to throw this one in here because lots of people assume they need a car if they love nature! Not so. While you of course have the option to rent or borrow a car, we find that not having a car can also be a great excuse to explore those places that are reachable via transit and bike.
### Nature accessible via bus in Milwaukee
Milwaukee has lovely places you can access without a car. Here are some favorites:
- Grant Park (via the 15)
- Hank Aaron State Trail, from X to Y
- Oak Leaf Trail
- Havenswoods State Forest
### Bike camping
Yes, you can go camping...with your bike! To do this, you will need a reasonably well-maintained bike, storage for your stuff, generally light-weight camping gear, some experience putting in miles on the bike, and a plan for mechanical or other issues. That said, unless you are very hardcore, you are unlikely to find yourself truly in the middle of no where. Don't let fear stop you from trying this; people on bike trails are likely happy to help you.
Here are some ideas
### Going up north...or the rest of Wisconsin!
Want to go up north but hate the drive? Wisconsin has buses that go up north. While it's a bit of a long ride and not the best hours, we think it's important for you to know that even if you are car-free, you can enjoy some of the most beautiful parts of the state.
