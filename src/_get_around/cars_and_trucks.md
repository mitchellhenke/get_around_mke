title: Cars and Trucks
---

For many people, not owning a car does not mean that they will never use a car. Cars and trucks can be occasional tools even for car-free or "car-lite" households.
Some times you may want or need a car or truck:

- Moving to a new home
- Transporting large or awkward objects such as furniture or Christmas trees
- Sudden transportation needs, such as when missing a bus
- Going to somewhere in the region or further that does not have transit access

If you need a car or truck, there are several options. While these options do cost money, they are often significantly cheaper than full-time car ownership, unless you are frequently using a vehicle. Below, we list the options and considerations for each.

## Renting from a Traditional Rental Company

## Renting from Zipcar

## Renting Trucks and Large Vehicles

## Rideshare and Taxi

## Hiring Movers
