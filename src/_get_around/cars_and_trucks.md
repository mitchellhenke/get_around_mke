title: Cars and Trucks
---

For many people, not owning a car does not mean that they will never use a car. Cars and trucks can be occasional tools even for car-free or "car-lite" households.
Some times you may want or need a car or truck:

- Moving to a new home
- Transporting large or awkward objects such as furniture or Christmas trees
- Sudden transportation needs, such as when missing a bus
- Going to somewhere in the region or further that does not have transit access

If you need a car or truck, there are several options. While these options do cost money, they are often significantly cheaper than full-time car ownership, unless you are frequently using a vehicle. Below, we list the options and considerations for each.

## Renting from a Traditional Rental Company

One obvious solution for temporary car use is a rental car. You can rent these by searching directly on a company's website, websites like Kayak or Expedia, or by calling rental companies. Rental prices have been going up in recent years (just like purchasing cars), but renting can still be an economical option.
Generally, you need to be above the age of 25 to rent a car. Some companies will rent to younger drivers for an additional cost. You must have a valid driver’s license.
Rental fleets vehicles are becoming increasingly large. If you prefer a sedan or a smaller SUV, try to rent from airport locations, which usually have the best selection. The Milwaukee airport is accessible via the GREEN and 80 lines. If you are going on a longer trip, we recommend renting a car with cruise control. As always, familiarize yourself with the car and its functions before leaving the lot.

You will need to return a rental car to the original location, unless you want to pay a premium for one-way trips.

### Car Insurance

If you are car-free, you likely do not have auto insurance. It can be very confusing to get short-term insurance coverage. There are two main types of insurance for rental cars: liability (if you are responsible for a crash) and collision (which covers damages to the car). We recommend both, and potentially additional medical coverage if you do not have medical insurance.

We highly recommend insurance. You cannot prevent every crash, and even relatively minor damage to the car can be very expensive. When adding insurance, be sure to also cover every driver who may drive the car.

You generally have several options:
- Purchase directly from the rental company. This seems like an expensive option, but it will ensure that you have both collision and liability coverage. For rare coverage (e.g. a few trips a year), this is your easiest (and likely cheapest) option if you do not have credit card coverage.
- Purchase a short-term insurance policy. This is a good option if you will be using a rental car (or borrowing a car) for a more substantial period of time. Most companies will only allow you to buy a policy for 6 months or more at a time, so this may be expensive unless you really need the coverage.
- Use your credit card. Your credit card may have rental car insurance (collision). Use that credit card to pay for the car. Check your credit card benefits before every rental, as companies sometimes change their benefits. If you use this option, reject the rental car company’s coverage. You may, however, need to purchase liability or medical coverage.

## Renting from Zipcar

Zipcar can be a great option for shorter (mileage and days) trips. Essentially, you rent cars that are parked in public places. You also do not need to pay out of pocket for gas or insurance, as they are included in the costs.
Zipcar approximately costs:
- $9/month or $90/year
- Per-hour costs, usually $12-16/hour, with option to rent per-half-hour or per-day

Zipcar includes:
- Gas (yes, free gas!)
- Secondary car insurance (and ability to buy additional insurance)
- Maintenance and 24/7 roadside assistance
- 200 miles per day ($0.67 per mile fee for additional miles)

### Some things to consider when using Zipcar:
- Zipcar does not have a broad geographic reach in Milwaukee. Most cars are downtown/East Side.
- You will need to return a Zipcar to the original location - no one-way trips.
- Per-hour costs can add up. Zipcars can be a good solution for things like an occasional trip to a family's house in the region or a large shopping haul (such as furnishing a new apartment). For longer trips, it may make more sense to rent from a traditional rental company.
- Zipcar availability can be limited at the last minute. If you need to get somewhere on short notice and there are no Zipcars available, consider the bus, a rideshare/taxi, or a combination of modes (if one mode does not take you to your destination directly).
- Unfortunately, Zipcar's fleet is growing in size (e.g. more oversized vehicles). Please be very careful when driving these, as they have large blind spots and are extremely dangerous for people outside the vehicle.

## Renting Trucks and Large Vehicles

In addition to traditional car rental companies, if you need a truck or van, you have options.

Places that rent trucks and vans:
- U-Haul: Rates start at about $20/day, plus mileage fees. There are several U-Haul locations around the Milwaukee area. We've had great experiences with the one at 2020 W State St, Milwaukee, WI 53233. 
- Home Depot has truck, van, and box truck rentals available by the hour or the day. Insurance is required. 

## Rideshare and Taxi

Rideshare and taxis can be expensive, but they can also be useful tools for one-way trips, unexpected trips, or even connecting modes of transportation.

- Taxis: VisitMilwaukee recommends [zTrip](https://www.ztrip.com/milwaukee/), a local taxi company. They have an app, website, phone, and on-street hailing options. Some wheelchair-accessible vans are available.
- Uber and Lyft both function in the Milwaukee area via app.
- [Turo](https://turo.com/) allows you to rent privately owned cars.

## Hiring Movers

Moving to a new home is a frequently-cited challenge when people consider using cars less. But hiring movers can be an economical and good option, especially if you are saving hundreds or thousands of dollars by not owning or using a car.

### What movers do
You can hire a mover for all or a part of your move. Obviously, the more things you have, and the more you have movers do, it will become more expensive. Most moving companies offer these services:
- Packing
- Unpacking
- Loading a truck (such as a U-Haul you rent)
- Unloading a truck
- Bringing your things between your new homes

We split up these services to show you that you can save money by identifing where you need help most with your move. For example, maybe you are moving from a ground floor to a third floor apartment. You might rent a cheap U-Haul truck, drive it yourself, pack your own things, and get help from friends to load the truck. Then, you can hire movers to unload the truck to move your things up several flights of stairs.

### Cost of movers
Get quotes from multiple moving companies, at least a few weeks in advance. You will sometimes have the option to choose how many movers to hire. More movers will cost more per hour, but may be overall cheaper as it may take less time.

### Can't afford movers?
If movers are too expensive for your situation, consider seeking assistance for moving costs. Get ideas for assistance [here](https://www.mymove.com/moving/costs-and-finances/low-income-moving-assistance/).
